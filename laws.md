# Laws

For laws containing the word "OR", the Judge must choose between the two versions and pass one of them. For laws without an "OR", the Judge decides whether to pass or reject the law.

By default, all laws are only valid for one day.
Permanent laws are marked with a [Permanent] tag and remain in effect for the duration of the game, unless otherwise stated.

## Voting laws

- **Alphabetical disenfranchisement**: Only people with the letter 'a' in their first name can vote OR only people with the letter 'e' in their first name can vote.
- **Age restriction**: Only people over 30 can vote OR only people under 30 can vote.
- **Optical discrimination**: Only people who wear glasses can vote OR only people who do not wear glasses can vote.
- **Dexterity discrimination**: Only left-handed people can vote OR only right-handed people can vote.
- **Public persona paradigm**: Only people with a public role can vote OR only people without a public role can vote.
- **Posthumous privileges** [Permanent]: Dead Werewolves can vote.
- **Designated friends**: Instead of voting against someone, everyone points at two people at the same time. Anyone who is not pointed at by anyone is condemned.
- **Dictatorship** [Permanent]: Only the Mayor can vote. At the end of each night, a new phase is introduced: people (including the Mayor) can open their eyes to cause the Mayor's downfall. If a strict majority of people open their eyes, the Mayor is condemned and this law is discarded. This law supersedes all existing laws, and no new laws is passed while this law is in effect.
- **Electoral flux**: No vote is organized, and no one is condemned OR two votes are organized, and two people are condemned.
- **Deadlock demise**: In the event of a tied vote, the Mayor is condemned OR the Judge is condemned.
- **Representative democracy**: The Judge divides the players into three groups, each containing at least one person. Each group chooses a representative, who is the only member allowed to vote on behalf of the group.
- **Trial**: The Judge chooses a defendant, a lawyer and a prosecutor. The lawyer and prosecutor each have 30 seconds to present their case. All players then vote to either convict or pardon the defendant, with the Judge breaking any ties. This vote replaces the standard voting procedure.
- **Two-round system**: The vote to condemn occurs in two rounds. The top two candidates from the first round advance to the second round. In the event of a tie in either round, the Mayor breaks the tie.
- **Minority verdict**: The person with the fewest votes is condemned. In the event of a tie, the Mayor decides who is condemned.
- **Sanctuary**: The Judge chooses a player who is immune to being voted against.

## Behavior Laws

A penalty of one vote against the person who broke the law is applied for each violation.

- **Language restriction**: People are not allowed to speak English OR people must speak with a foreign accent.
- **Verbal restraint**: Only the Mayor can speak before the vote OR each person can only speak for a maximum of 5 seconds before the vote.
- **Taboo**: The Judge chooses a word. This word must not be spoken during the debates.
- **Political reboot** [Permanent]: The government is dismissed, and new elections are held.
- **Orderly discourse**: Except for the Mayor, players must raise their hands before speaking. The Mayor decides who may speak.
- **Nonverbal communication**: Players must communicate using gestures only OR players must use a specific gesture, chosen by the Judge (e.g., a hand wave), each time they speak.

## Other Laws

- **Dead law**: The Dean of the Dead draws two laws and passes one of them.
- **Power shift** [Permanent]: The Judge takes the place of the Mayor, and the Mayor takes the place of the Judge.
