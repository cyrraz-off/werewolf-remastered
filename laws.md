* Instead of voting against someone, everyone points at two people at the same time. Anyone who is not pointed at by anyone is condemned.
* (End of democracy) Only the mayor can vote until the end of the game. At the end of each night, a new phase is introduced: people (including the mayor) can open their eyes to cause the mayor's downfall. If a strict majority of people open their eyes, the mayor is condemned and this law is discarded. This law supersedes any other law.
