# Joan

* **Scooby Snack**: Joan finds a Scooby Snack in the mailbox and chooses to either:
  * Eat it (protects against a single night attack),
  * Pocket it for later, or
  * Discard it.

* **Posters**: Joan selects a player they dislike. The next day, the game master announces that posters portraying that player as a werewolf are found in the village.

* **Love**:
  * Joan selects a player to fall in love with.
  * If this player is already one of Cupid's lovers, a throuple is formed. The three lovers' new victory condition is to be the last three surviving players. If one dies, all die.
  * Otherwise, Joanâ€™s victory condition remains unchanged, but if their chosen lover dies, Joan also dies.

* **Room Cleaning**: Joan may clean their room. The room remains clean for the rest of the current game and the next game.

* **Communication with the Dead**: Joan may attempt to communicate with the dead. Each dead person writes one letter or number on a piece of paper, which Joan can read.

* **Stranger at the Door**: Joan may open their door to a stranger. The dead decide privately whether the stranger is powerless or a god who can protect Joan in exchange for services.

* **Potion Creation**: Joan may try to create and drink a potion. The dead decide whether the potion:
  * Is deadly,
  * Transforms Joan into a werewolf, or
  * Solidifies into a Scooby Snack.

* **Garden Gnome Theft**: Joan may select a player to steal their garden gnome. If werewolves target that player during that night, Joan dies instead of the intended victim.

* **Magic Set**: Joan may play with a magic set. The dead decide whether:
  * The magic set causes the sun to rise, ending the night,
  * The set explodes, killing Joan, or
  * The set grants Joan the power of the Fortune Teller for the night.

* **Mushroom**: Joan finds a mushroom and may eat it. The dead decide if it is:
  * A protective mushroom (saves Joan from death),
  * A hallucinogenic mushroom, or
  * A harmless button mushroom with no effect.
