### Cupid (2)

* Night 1 (arrow of love): Cupid selects two players who fall in love. Cupid sleeps, the lovers wake up, recognise each other, and indicate with a sign whether each of them is a werewolf.

If later in the game one of the two lovers dies, the other lover dies too.
* Night 2 (arrow of hate): Cupid selects two players who become haters. Cupid sleeps, the haters wake up and recognise each other. The first time one of the haters, say hater A, should die, hater A may choose to not die and lie between life and death instead. A player between life and death cannot speak, vote or use the power of a public role during the day, but can still use their power during the night. If later in the game, the other hater, say hater B, dies and if hater A had chosen to lie between life and death, then hater A becomes fully alive.
* Night 3 (arrow of rivalry): Cupid selects two players who become rivals. Cupid sleeps, the rivals wake up and recognise each other. A rival wins the game if and only if (1) their side wins AND (2) their rival is dead at the end of the game.
