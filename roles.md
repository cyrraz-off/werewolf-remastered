Public roles

### Sheriff
* Every night (noise in the dark): right after the werewolves select their victim, the sheriff chooses a player to protect.
If the protected player is the target of the werewolves, the game master informs everyone that the attack of the werewolves fails thanks to the action of the sheriff.

### Knight
* Passive (pardon): once in the game after a player is sentenced to death by the village, the knight may cancel that sentence. There is no new vote to replace the cancelled sentence.

Private roles

### Werewolf
* Every night (hunting time): the werewolves select any player. That player dies. If the werewolves do not agree on the choice of the victim, the relative majority rule applies. In case of tie, the oldest among the werewolf players breaks the tie.

### Hunter
* Passive (last cartridge): when the hunter dies, the hunter selects another player. That player dies too.
* Night 3 (send the dog to smell):  the hunter selects another player. The game master tells the hunter whether that player is a werewolf or not.
* Night 5 (send the birds to blind): the hunter selects another player. That player cannot open their eyes until the end of the game.

### Priest
* Night 2 and following nights (ask for confession): the priest may select another player. That player wakes up. If the selected player is a werewolf, the priest dies. Otherwise, the selected player can see who is the priest.

### Bourgeois
* Passive ("I am innocent!"): at any time during the game after the election of the mayor and of the government, the bourgeois may reveal their role of bourgeois.
